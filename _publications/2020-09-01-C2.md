# Abstract
Software development is known to be a social activity that involves developers, project managers, and stakeholders. Recent studies have proved a direct relation between social and technical aspects, e.g., poor coordination among developers may lead to an increase of technical debt in source code. The so-called socio-technical congruence measures the level of coordination existing in an organization at their different levels. In this late-breaking idea paper, we propose a novel way to employ the socio-technical congruence in the context of source code quality improvement: we design a community-based refactoring recommendation approach that aims at optimizing socio-technical congruence while keeping into account the source code dependencies among the components of a software project. A search-based algorithm is employed to this purpose and we envision the novel approach to be suitable for providing Extract Class and Extract Package refactoring recommendations.
